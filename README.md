# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Model

This repository contains a simple yet powerful **Machine Learning project** that predicts the species of Iris flowers using features like petal and sepal dimensions.

📁 **Project Type**: Supervised Learning  
📚 **Technique**: Classification  
🧠 **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier  
🎯 **Purpose**: Codetch Internship - Machine Learning Model Implementation

## 🚀 Objective

The goal is to classify Iris flowers into one of three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

based on four input features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Dataset

We used the popular **Iris dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is also available through `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()
